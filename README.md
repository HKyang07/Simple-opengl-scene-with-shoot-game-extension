# Simple-opengl-scene-with-shoot-game-extension

A simple opengl scene I built for my course assignment then add a shoot game extension to it.  
WASD to roam, mouse drag to change view direction.  
Press X to start game, then the camera will be fixed and use mouse click the target.  
I add some funny sound effect :)

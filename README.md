# Simple-opengl-scene-with-shoot-game-extension

A simple opengl scene I built for my course assignment then add a shoot game extension to it.  
WASD to roam, MOUSE drag to change view direction, SPACE to enable automatic rotation.  
Press X to start and end game, then the camera will be fixed and use mouse click the target.  
I add some funny sound effects :)

Build in Visual Studio 2013, require external system glut.h  
Executable file and resource files are in /Release  
Source code is in /TheFinal
